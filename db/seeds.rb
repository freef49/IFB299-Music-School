# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Seeds for the user database. 
# Currently seeds one admin (Admin has two interviews)
# Seeds 5 completely random teachers (Each teacher has a random number of availabilities and skills)
# Seeds 20 completely random students (Each student has a random number of preferences and free play room bookings)
